I'm Polepalle Venkata Sai Harsha, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student diving deep into the exciting world of technology. 🚀

## 💻 Tech Enthusiast  
- 🔍 Constantly exploring emerging technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends.  
- 💡 Driven by the passion for solving complex problems with innovative solutions.

## 💻 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL  
- **Skills:** Machine Learning

## 🌱 Currently Learning  
- Exploring the fascinating fields of **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Lifelong learning is my philosophy, and I love taking on new challenges.

## Projects:
- **Phishing Attack Detection** (Ongoing): I am currently working on a project that detects phishing URLs using a combination of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language models (LLM). The dataset includes features such as URL length, IP address, and domain-related information, which help the ML and DL models differentiate between phishing and legitimate URLs. For the LLM-based approach, I focus solely on analyzing the URL text and its label. The goal is to improve detection accuracy and create a robust model that can be deployed for real-time phishing detection.
- **Employee Churn Prediction**: This project aims to predict employee churn, identifying factors that lead to attrition using machine learning models. By analyzing key features such as employee satisfaction, work-life balance, and other organizational data, the model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. This helps organizations implement retention strategies to maintain their workforce and reduce turnover rates.
- **Price Prediction using Web Scraping**: A tool for scraping historical product prices from e-commerce websites and analyzing trends over time. This project uses web scraping to gather past price data, providing insights and visualizations of price fluctuations.
